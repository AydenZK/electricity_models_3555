```{r}
library(fpp3)
library(dplyr)

source("../src/train_dhr.R")
```


```{r}
austria <- load_dhr_data("Austria")

elec_austria_fit <- austria$train %>% 
  model(
    dhr = ARIMA(TotalLoadValue ~ fourier(period="year", K=4), 
                stepwise=FALSE, order_constraint = (p+q <= 6 & P+Q <= 2)),
    arima = ARIMA(TotalLoadValue, stepwise=FALSE, 
                  order_constraint = (p+q <= 6 & P+Q <= 2)),
    ets = ETS(TotalLoadValue)
  )

accuracy(elec_austria_fit)
```

We notice that the DHR model has the lowest MAE, MAPE and RMSSE. 


```{r}
forecast(elec_austria_fit, h = 400) %>% 
  autoplot(austria$train)
```

From these forecasts we see that the DHR also does the best in picking up 
the seasonal/cyclical behaviors.


```{r}
# Model Details
dhr_mod = elec_austria_fit$dhr
dhr_mod
```

We see that the model is an a regression with K=4 Fourier terms and ARIMA(5,0,1)(2,1,0)[7] errors.


```{r}
## Save Model
save(dhr_mod, file="../models/austria_dhr.rda")
```


### We tried other countries as well, as we see that the grid search does not provide as good a fit.

```{r}
belgium <- load_dhr_data("Belgium")
italy <- load_dhr_data("Italy")
croatia <- load_dhr_data("Croatia")
spain <- load_dhr_data("Spain")
```

```{r}
elec_belgium_fit <- belgium$train %>%
  model(
    dhr = ARIMA(TotalLoadValue ~ fourier(period="year", K=4), 
                stepwise=FALSE,
                order_constraint = (p+q <= 6 & P+Q <= 2))
  )

accuracy(elec_belgium_fit)

forecast(elec_belgium_fit, h = 400) %>% 
  autoplot(belgium$train)
```

```{r}
elec_spain_fit <- spain$train %>%
  model(
    dhr = ARIMA(TotalLoadValue ~ fourier(period="year", K=4), 
                stepwise=FALSE,
                order_constraint = (p+q <= 6 & P+Q <= 2))
  )

accuracy(elec_spain_fit)


forecast(elec_spain_fit, h = 400) %>% autoplot(elec_spain$train)
```

```{r}
elec_croatia_fit <- croatia$train %>%
  model(
    dhr = ARIMA(TotalLoadValue ~ fourier(period="year", K=4), 
                stepwise=FALSE,
                order_constraint = (p+q <= 6 & P+Q <= 2))
  )

accuracy(elec_croatia_fit)


forecast(elec_croatia_fit, h = 400) %>% autoplot(croatia$train)
```


```{r}
elec_italy_fit <- italy$train %>%
  model(
    dhr = ARIMA(TotalLoadValue ~ fourier(period="year", K=4), 
                stepwise=FALSE,
                order_constraint = (p+q <= 6 & P+Q <= 2))
  )

accuracy(elec_italy_fit)

autoplot(elec_italy)
